# 🤖 AI-ML-LLM

Welcome to my personal collection of **AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Large Language Model (LLM)** projects!

This repository is a playground of experiments, insights, and applications I've worked on as I grow my skills in data science, deep learning, and modern LLM frameworks. Feel free to explore, learn from, and adapt anything you find useful.

## 📁 What's Inside

Here you'll find a range of projects, including:

- 🤖 LLM-based applications using OpenAI, Hugging Face, and LangChain
- 📊 Machine Learning models for classification, regression, and clustering
- 🔤 NLP pipelines with tokenization, embeddings, and transformers
- ⚙️ Experimentation with frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn

> 📌 Each project is well-commented — check inside the notebooks or scripts for detailed explanations and learnings.
