## The Models are not available

If you run my projects in your system, you can save the models, the code is already there.
Store them in a models folder and drop them in the Model_Mini_App folder
then you will be able to run the streamlit apps


## The Streamlit stack order
The streamlit framework, requires the main page be seperate from other pages
which is why the FoodVision isnt in the pages folder, search streamlit on google and read the docs
